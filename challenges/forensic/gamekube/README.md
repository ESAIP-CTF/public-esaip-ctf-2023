Oh crap, a server hosting a Wordpress website on a kubernetes cluster have been compromised only few hours before it creation...

It seems that King Boo hired a pro hacker in order to hack it.

You are engaged by the *Luigi's Mansion SOC* in order to find what happened.

You need 3 information :
- The CVE used in order to compromised the Wordpress.
- The file changed in the wordpress in order to gain a remote access to the server.
- The sensitive file path retrieved by the attacker on the server.

Format of the flag: ```ECTF{CVE-2020-11111:index.php:/path/of/sensitive/file}```
