# Mario visits the human kingdom 3/3

While scrolling through the de.rouille.et.de.briques Instagram account, Mario found a three-towered castle that Princess Peach might like.

Unfortunately he can't figure out the name of it.

Could you help him find the name and address of the castle?

Flag format : ```ECTF{castle_name:address}```

Flag example : ```ECTF{chateau_de_versailles:2_rue_des_champignons_75000_paris}```
