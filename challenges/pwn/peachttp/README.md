# PeacHTTP

Peach has just created her blog but does not want to be like the others, she has set up her own HTTP server to stand out from the crowd. 
Prove to her that sometimes it's better to stay modest...

**Note:** You have to PoC first in local with the docker provided and then open a ticket to get an instance launched for you
