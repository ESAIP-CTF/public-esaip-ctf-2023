# What CAN I do 1/2

**IMPORTANT: This challenge was really complicated to develop, we know that you can mess with the network of other teams. It's not the aim of this challenge so please, don't attack interfaces that are not yours and do not attack the server.**

Something is wrong with Toad's kart, we managed to isolate one ECU from his kart after the end of the race. Gather information on the services running on this ECU, you might find something !

*You need to use the ssh information you received to access the challenge on the virtual can interface.*
