# Arcade Game 3000 2/2

After breaking through the Nantendo secret room, you found yourself in front of a imposing black box with a screen on it.

It seems like they are trying to rebrand old games for arcade machines.

We have sucessfuly dumped the game of the machine, and you can find the files below.

The game we are in possesion is not finished yet, but I'm sure you can find something interesting inside!

When you think you found the easter egg, you can come test your solve on the real arcade machine to get the flag (controls are in `instructions.jpg`).
